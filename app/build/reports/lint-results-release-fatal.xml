        severity="Fatal"
        message="`commons-logging` defines classes that conflict with classes now provided by Android. Solutions include finding newer versions or alternative libraries that don&apos;t have the same problem (for example, for `httpclient` use `HttpUrlConnection` or `okhttp` instead), or repackaging the library using something like `jarjar`."

        summary="Duplicate Platform Classes"
        explanation="There are a number of libraries that duplicate not just functionality of the Android platform but using the exact same class names as the ones provided in Android -- for example the apache http classes. This can lead to unexpected crashes.&#xA;&#xA;To solve this, you need to either find a newer version of the library which no longer has this problem, or to repackage the library (and all of its dependencies) using something like the `jarjar` tool, or finally, rewriting the code to use different APIs (for example, for http code, consider using `HttpUrlConnection` or a library like `okhttp`.)">
